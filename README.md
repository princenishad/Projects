Credit Risk (Default Probabilty Modeling)

With more than 272 variables right from categorical to binary (customer level segmentation has been used to create another 50 categorical, data manipulated and dummy variables)
Using Light GBM as a singleton ensembling model for model creation and implementation we created Stratified K = 5 fold samples of our train dataset.

International Trade Research Paper (Analysing Bilateral Trade Relation between India and China)

Under this research project 2 Linear regression models were created to study the quality and pattern of 
trade taking place between two countries (vis-a-vis other developing economies) from the year 2009 to 2020. 
Moreover econometrics tools such as fixed effects and interaction effects were used to determine country level and category level 
impact on the dependent variable.


Portfolio Optimization with CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) as Risk factor Creating scenario losses (Convex to Conic Reformulation)


For this project 96 different stocks from NYSE where used to create a optimized portfolio with return scenarios created 
using Multi-variate normalized distribution (Monte-Carlo Simulation) which accounts for Transactional Cost (MILP) , 
Market Impact Cost (optimized using Quadratic Power Cones) and threshold CVaR risk for different delta values (risk coefficient) 
in order to Maximize Utility function (Objective).
